x Checkmate

- Check: Detect when a king is under threat from an opponent's piece. The king must move out of check or block the check with another piece.

- Stalemate: Recognize when a player has no legal moves left but is not in check. The game ends in a draw.

- Draw by Threefold Repetition: Declare a draw if the same position occurs three times in a game with the same player to move.

- Draw by Fifty-Move Rule: Declare a draw if no capture or pawn move has occurred in the last 50 consecutive moves by both players.

- Draw by Insufficient Material: Recognize when neither player has sufficient material left on the board to deliver checkmate (e.g., king vs. king, king vs. king and bishop/knight).

- Castling: Implement the rules for castling, including kingside and queenside castling. Ensure that the king and rook have not moved before.

- En passant: Allow the capturing of a pawn "in passing" when a pawn moves two squares forward from its starting position and lands next to an opponent's pawn.

- Promotion: Enable pawn promotion when a pawn reaches the opponent's back rank, allowing the player to choose a queen, rook, bishop, or knight as the promoted piece.

- Draw Offers: Implement the ability for players to offer or accept draws during a game.

- Resignation: Allow players to resign the game when they wish to concede.

- Game Over: Properly declare the game over when a checkmate, stalemate, draw by repetition, draw by fifty-move rule, or other draw condition occurs.

- Undo Move: Provide an option for players to undo their last move, with limitations to avoid abuse.

- Draw Confirmation: Ask players for confirmation when a draw condition is met (e.g., threefold repetition) before declaring a draw.

- Sound and Visual Feedback: Use sound effects, animations, or visual cues to indicate critical game events, such as check and checkmate.
